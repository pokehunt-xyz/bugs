# PokéHunt

Welcome to PokéHunt, the Best Pokémon experience on Discord and Telegram.

On our GitHub you can see various repositories containing the code we use for our bot(s) and website.

## Repositories

This repository is the general repository and can be used to report bugs and open feature requests.

- The Discord bot can be found [here](https://github.com/pokehunt-xyz/discord)
- The Telegram bot can be found [here](https://github.com/pokehunt-xyz/telegram)
- The Website can be found [here](https://github.com/pokehunt-xyz/website)

## Reporting bugs

You can use this GitHub repository to create an issue/file a bug report. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can always DM one of the owners of PokéHunt and they can open one for you. For every new/unknown bug you report, you **might** get a small reward (depending on the severity of the bug).

Please note that missing or wrong Pokémon data (such as moves, images, etc) do not count as a "bug" with the bot but an issue with data.
- Report missing/wrong moves [here](https://github.com/pokehunt-xyz/pokehunt-xyz/issues/5)

In case of bugs that should not be made public (such as bot-breaking issues, security issues, etc), please ALWAYS send an email to `support@pokehunt.xyz` and/or DM the owner instead of creating a (public accessible) bug report here.
